# ICE Black Forest Cake

Inspired by the high-speed Intercity-Express (ICE) trains that whisk passengers across Germany, this dessert is a nod to the country's famous Black Forest cake. Layers of chocolate sponge, whipped cream, and cherries mirror the speed and comfort of the ICE, while embodying the flavors of the Black Forest region.

## Ingredients

* 4 large eggs
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 130g all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 jar (24 oz) sour cherries, drained (reserve the juice)
* 2 tablespoons cherry liqueur (optional)
* Dark chocolate shavings, for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Cake Layers:**
   * Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
   * In a large bowl, beat eggs and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add to the egg mixture, alternating with milk, until well combined.
   * Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely.

2. **Whip the Cream:**
   * In a chilled bowl, beat the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Set aside in the fridge.

3. **Assemble the Cake:**
   * Once the cakes are cooled, slice each cake horizontally into two layers, creating four layers in total.
   * Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Brush with cherry liqueur (optional), then spread with a layer of whipped cream and a layer of sour cherries. Repeat with the remaining layers, finishing with a layer of whipped cream on top and on the sides.

4. **Decorate:**
   * Garnish the top of the cake with dark chocolate shavings and additional sour cherries. Drizzle some reserved cherry juice over the top for an extra touch of moisture and flavor.

5. **Chill and Serve:**
   * Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and the cake to firm up for easier slicing.

Enjoy your culinary journey with this decadent ICE Black Forest Cake, a tribute to the speed and sophistication of the Intercity-Express, and the timeless allure of the Black Forest.
