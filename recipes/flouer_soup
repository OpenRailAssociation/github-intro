Inspired by the hard working railway worker and the Basler Mehlsuppe
## Ingredients
* 150 grams wheat flour
* 50 grams butter
* 2 onions
* 2 liters beef or vegetable broth
* salt according to taste
* pepper according to taste
* nutmeg according to taste
* 2 tablespoons Madeira or port wine (optional)
## Instructions
1. * First, peel and finely chop the onions.
2. * In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat and add the chopped onions. Saut√© the onions in the butter until translucent and soft, but do not brown.
3. * Make a roux. Add the flour to the pot and mix well with the butter and onions. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly for about 5 to 10 minutes, until the flour gets a golden brown color.
4. * Slowly pour in the broth while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
5. * Reduce the heat and simmer the soup slightly for 1 to 1.5 hours. Stir occasionally.
